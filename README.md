NapLight
========

A reverse Nite-Lite, letting kids know when they can get out of their beds.

The NapLight uses a DS1307 RTC breakout and Max7219 LED Matrix Breakout to cause the 'Snake' animation to play each day at the times specified in NapLight.onlist.

This project can work on any Arduino using the I2C pins to connect to the RTC and SPI to connect to the Matrix, but here is a quick sketch of my layout, using an Arduino Pro Mini 5v 16MHz.  For more details, see the sketch file.
